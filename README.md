# Caffe for DeconvNet and DecoupledNet

Martin Kersner, <m.kersner@gmail.com>

This branch contains version of caffe which is required by [DeconvNet](https://github.com/martinkersner/py-DeconvNet) and [DecoupledNet](https://github.com/martinkersner/py-DecoupledNet). 
Caffe was created by merging [original caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) and [HyeonwooNoh's caffe](https://github.com/HyeonwooNoh/caffe) (very old version of caffe).
